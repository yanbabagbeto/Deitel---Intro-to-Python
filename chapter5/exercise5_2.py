# 5.2 (Whatâ€™s Does This Code Do?) What does the following function do, based on the
# sequence it receives as an argument?
# def mystery(sequence):
# return sequence == sorted(sequence)

# This code will return a True or False. Normally it will always return False because comparing the 2 objects sequence and sorted sequence will always point to deferent adresses.
